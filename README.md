## Model-based regularization ‚ú®
 ‚ÑπÔ∏è Model-based regularization applies a global, user-defined model on the deformation. 

**global smoothness**

**local discontinuities**

**inverse consistency and cycle consistency**

**local invertibility**

**volume preservation**

**diffeomorphisms**

**physics-inspired properties**

## Problem-specific regularization ‚ú®
‚ÑπÔ∏è Problem-specific regularization is tailired towards the data by taking additional data knowledge into account. It is often spatially-adaptive.

**multi-structure registration**

**images with topology changes**
- **missing regions**
- **shrinking/growing regions**

**organ-specific motion**

- **sliding motion**
- **cyclic motion**

## learned regularization ‚ú®
‚ÑπÔ∏è Learned regularization uses ML/DL models to learn spatially-adaptive deformation properties from a training dataset.

**learned local smoothness properties**

**learned feasible deformation spaces**

**test time adaptive regularization**
