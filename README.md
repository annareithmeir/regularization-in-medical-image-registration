## Model-based regularization ‚ú®
 ‚ÑπÔ∏è Model-based regularization applies a global, user-defined model on the deformation. 

Some modular code bases with model-based methods:
- Autograd Image Registration Laboratory: [https://github.com/airlab-unibas/airlab](https://github.com/airlab-unibas/airlab)
  - Isotropic total variation, anisotropic total variation, diffusion
- MONAI :[https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/losses.html#registration-losses](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/losses.html#registration-losses)
  - Bending energy, diffusion
- FAIR: Flexible Algorithms for Image Registration :[https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m](https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m)
  - curvature, linear elastic, hyper-elastic

## Problem-specific regularization ‚ú®
‚ÑπÔ∏è Problem-specific regularization is tailored towards the data by taking additional data knowledge into account. It is often spatially-adaptive.

**multi-structure registration**

**images with topology changes**
- **missing regions**
- **shrinking/growing regions**

**organ-specific motion**

- **sliding motion**
- **cyclic motion**

## learned regularization ‚ú®
‚ÑπÔ∏è Learned regularization uses ML/DL models to learn spatially-adaptive deformation properties from a training dataset.

**learned local smoothness properties**

**learned feasible deformation spaces**

**test time adaptive regularization**
